\section{Introduction}

This is a sample document to show you a bit about how TeX works.  If you've never used TeX before, I recommend opening the template.tex file and the template.pdf file at the same time for comparison.  

\subsection{Structure}
The information at the top of template.tex tells the compiler how to format the finished document.  Commands shown in blue and preceded by a backslash give instructions and are often followed by supplemental information in curly brackets.  The  line `` (backslash) begin \{ document \} "  introduces the body of the paper.  Any ``begin" command must get paired with an ``end" command; look at the last line in this template.

\subsection{Math Mode}\label{section:mathmode}
% If you're wondering about the ``\label" above, it will be explained below.  Note that this line of text which follows the percent sign doesn't show up in the pdf.  This is a good way to leave notes for yourself on a work in progress.
Some formatting can be done in text mode (for example, you can make the font \textit{italic} or \textbf{boldface}), but for most mathematical symbols, you'll have to use math mode.  Math mode is most often introduced and ended with a \$.  For example, in math mode I can write the equation $x+ y=7$ and the program takes care of spacing.  It's also easy to write Greek letters ($\alpha$, $\Sigma$), exponents ($2^{x+y}$), and subscripts ($x_1$).  Look in any LaTeX guide to find a list of symbols and formatting commands.  

\section{References}
One of the nice things about using LaTeX is that it makes internal references easy.  For example, if I want to remind you where I discussed math mode, I can mention that it was in Section~\ref{section:mathmode}.  If you're looking at the pdf file, you see the correct reference, but in the TeX file I typed a label that I had attached to that section.  (You may need to typeset your document more than once to make the references show up correctly.)  Labels work for definitions, theorems, questions, sections, diagrams, and equations, among others.
